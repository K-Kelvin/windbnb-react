<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./src/images/windbnb.png)

-   My experience
    -   I enjoyed replicating the Figma designs of the project into actual code, and deploying the
        interactive, responsive site.
-   What I learnt/improved
    -   I have improved on planning and organising my code. I even got to work with Typescript for the first
        time and noticed a major improvement in error checking and intellisense.
-   My thought
    -   Nothing is impossible, get your attitude right, strive and change that to I'm possible ;)

### Built With
